# One of the simpler forms of Poker is five card draw.
# Each player is dealt five cards.
# Players bet; each player may fold, see the current bet, or raise.
# In turn, each player can choose to discard up to three cards.
# They are dealt new cards from the deck to replace their old cards.
# Players bet again.
# If any players do not fold, then players reveal their hands; strongest hand wins the pot.

# Game
# Holds the deck
# Keeps track of whose turn it is
# Keeps track of the amount in the pot.
